****** HTTP Server and client using Socket API *******

My implementation of an HTTP client and server running on a pared down
version of HTTP/1.0.

The HTTP server is being host in the cloude using AWS. 
I have a student account AWS ---> AWS educate

Highly recommend it 



FOR CLIENT:
	
	 The client takes command line arguments specifying a server name or IP address, the port on which to contact the server, the method you
	 use, and the path of the requested object on the server. I'm going to implement two methods of HTTP: GET and PUT.

FOR SERVER
